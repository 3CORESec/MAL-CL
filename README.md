## Contributing

If you find a process or a tool that has some command-line options that can or have been (ab)used, please consider contributing them. 

- Create a folder inside one of the available platforms (`Windows`, `Other`, `Antivirus`).
- Inside that folder create a `README.md` file.

You can use the template available [here](./Template) or simply copy one the already existsting README files and use it as a base. Please follow the same structure and don't remove any titles (all are required).

Looking forward to your awesome contributions.
